        <h2> Context </h2>
        <p> 
            The modern lifestyle has witnessed a significant shift towards health consciousness, with an increasing number of individuals becoming mindful of their calorie intake and dietary habits. This trend is now noticeable among the students of NID Bangalore, where a growing community of gym-goers and calorie-conscious individuals is emerging. Despite their best efforts, many students struggle with portion control, often due to the large plates and unlimited food options available in the college canteen.

        <h2> The WHY </h2>
        <p> 
            At NID Bangalore, it's not uncommon to hear students complaining about weight gain since joining the college. One of the reasons behind this issue is often the difficulty in controlling portions and understanding serving sizes, which is furthered by the canteen's unlimited food offerings. With an abundance of food available, students frequently consume more than their bodies require, leading to unintended weight gain.

            The primary objective of the project is to assist NID Bangalore students in achieving and maintaining a healthy diet by providing tools for portion control and calorie tracking.
